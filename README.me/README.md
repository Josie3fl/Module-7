# <RM-Generator >

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->
RM-Generator is capable of creating a README file for almost any project you can think of.
Our motivation to create such a file is the fact we were going to be working in the creation of multiple projects that required the presecence of a README file for the app.
It solves the problem of coming up with the basics of for the file, it creates the basic "esqueleton" for you README and if you need to add any modifications in the future you can. It was built with the iintention of giving a head start not a finished README file.
While building this I learned that building a README can be extremely helpful when it comes to the speed process of the project itself. It also provides a clear direction to where the project its headed.
